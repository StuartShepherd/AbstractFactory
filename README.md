# Factory Method Example
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.

Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating all distinct products but leaves the actual product creation to concrete factory classes. 
Each factory type corresponds to a certain product variety.

The client code calls the creation methods of a factory object instead of creating products directly with a constructor call (new operator). 
Since a factory corresponds to a single product variant, all its products will be compatible.

Client code works with factories and products only through their abstract interfaces. 
It allows the same client code to work with different products.
You just create a new concrete factory class and pass it to the client code.

## Usage examples
The Abstract Factory pattern is pretty common in C# code. Many frameworks and libraries use it to provide a way to extend and customize their standard components.

## Identification
* The pattern is easy to recognize by methods, which return a factory object. Then, the factory is used for creating specific sub-components.

## Applicability
Use the Abstract Factory when your code needs to work with various families of related products, but you don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products—they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow for future extensibility.
